# Multi-label Classifier using Keras API
This project is a sample for creating a basic multilabel ensemble classifier. It creates 'n' - number of fully connected neural network and predicts result from an ensemble of those models. The focus of the
project is only on creating a ensemble network and not on accurate model. The projects expects clean input data. 


## Prerequisites

The projects needs the following libraries - 
* Tensorflow
* Numpy
* Pands
* Matplotlib

Suggestions are welcome for further improvement of the project.
